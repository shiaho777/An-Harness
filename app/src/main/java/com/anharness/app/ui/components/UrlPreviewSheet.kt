 * Bottom-sheet web preview for a URL tapped inside chat markdown.

 * Thin wrapper around [WebPreviewBottomSheet]: callers that don't manage
 * their own [com.anharness.app.ui.preview.WebViewHolder] (most chat-side
 * link taps) get the same toolbar / sheet UX as the in-chat HTML preview
 * by going through this helper.
 *
 * Fullscreen expand is intentionally not exposed here — chat URL preview
 * was a single-sheet flow on iOS too.
